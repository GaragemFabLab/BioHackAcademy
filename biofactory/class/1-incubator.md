## Sinopse

Build your own incubator and start growing microbes under controlled conditions. During the class you will also get to know the fundamentals of microbiology. Weâ€™ll use our purple pigment bacteria as a standard, but you can also choose your own favourite biological agent. A crash course Arduino programming and soldering is included.
